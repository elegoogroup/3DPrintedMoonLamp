# 3D Printed Moon Lamp
Today is August 15th in Chinese Lunar Year, which is also known as the Mid-Autumn Festival in China. On this special day we eat Moon Cakes, enjoy time with families and praise the beauty of the full moon and its goddess Chang'e.
So as a new episode of our #ElegooTutorials, this year we made a #3DPrinted Moon Lamp based on #Arduino Nano to celebrate this lovely holiday with you all. You can DOWNLOAD the code, sketch and stl. files hereã€‚
